## Overview

**Paper Title:**  
*Predictive Modeling of MXene-Based Solar Absorbers Using Deep Neural Network*

**Authors:**  
Waleed Iqbal Waseer, Muhammad Abuzar Baqir, Muhammad Saqlain, Muhammad Junaid Mughal, and Shujaat Khan.

**Abstract (Brief):**  
- This work leverages a **deformable convolutional neural network** for predicting absorption spectra of **MXene-SiO<sub>2</sub>-Ag (MIM)** metasurface absorbers.  
- **Traditional EM simulations** (FDTD/FEM) are often time-consuming. Our **deep learning** approach accelerates this process while maintaining high accuracy.  
- **Grad-CAM** explainability provides insights into which regions of the metasurface design are most influential for absorption.  
- This method has strong potential for rapid, high-throughput design of solar absorbers, photodetectors, and other nanophotonic devices.
